# Project Description: Sales Analysis and Visualization
The Sales Analysis and Visualization project is a hands-on workshop designed to enhance your skills in data analysis and visualization using Python. In this project, you will work as a Data Analyst/Scientist in an organization and explore real-world commercial data.

## Project Goals
The main goals of this project are:

Gain practical experience in analyzing and visualizing commercial data.
Understand the importance of data visualization and analysis in making informed business decisions.
Develop proficiency in using Python libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization.
Explore techniques for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and answering key business questions.

## Project Overview
In this project, you will be provided with a dataset containing commercial data for the current year. The dataset includes information on sales, products, cities, and the timing of transactions.

Your task will be to analyze the data and extract meaningful insights to address specific business questions. Using Python and its data manipulation library, Pandas, you will clean and transform the data, perform exploratory data analysis, and visualize the results using Matplotlib.

Throughout the project, you will focus on answering important questions, such as:

What was the best month for sales? How much revenue was generated during that month?
Which city had the highest sales volume?
At what time should advertisements be displayed to maximize the likelihood of customer purchases?
Which product had the highest sales? Can you identify any factors contributing to its success?
By the end of this project, you will have gained practical experience in data analysis and visualization, as well as a deeper understanding of the role of data in making informed business decisions.

## Prerequisites
To participate in this project, you should have a basic understanding of Python programming and be familiar with fundamental data analysis concepts. Familiarity with Pandas and Matplotlib will be beneficial but not mandatory.

## Getting Started
This work was done in Google Colab and the notebook is available [here](https://github.com/Aritro30/sales_analysis_workshop_yorku/blob/main/sales_analysis_workshop_yorku.ipynb). To get started, ensure you have the necessary Python environment set up with the required libraries installed. The dataset will be provided to you at the beginning of the workshop.
